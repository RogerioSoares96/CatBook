# A website dedicated to share the best Cat pics in the Internet has to offer

The long term of objective of CatBook is to promote Cat pictures from the interwebs and present to the user an option to vote on their favorite.

The user will vote between 2 pictures using an Elo rating algorithm (Commonly used in Chess) to determine a final winner.

That final winner will have a vote tallied to it's name and the final winner will be decided each month!

Happy days for Cat lovers!
